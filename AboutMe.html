	<h1>Early life and National School</h1>
	<p>
		I was born in Luton, Bedfordshire on the 30<sup>th</sup> of July, and lived there for almost 2 years. My parent's then brought me to live in Ireland and we moved to a house in Athlone. I then went through nursery school, and was enrolled early into the local national school, Cornamaddy N.S. I then spent 8 years in National School before moving on to secondary school, to do the Junior and Leaving Certificate courses. I don't have much memory of my time there, only that I had few good friends, and people didn't really like me cuz I didn't play sports except basketball with the girls and not Gaelic football with the lads, but I guess that says more about them.

	<h1>Marist College Athlone</h1>
	<p>
		Here I spent 3 of the worst years of my life with people I didn't like and didn't resonate with, studying 14 subjects, half of which I had no interest in, for an exam that no employer or university in Ireland takes into consideration, the Junior Certificate. We were always told that if anything, it prepared us for the Leaving Certificate Examinations, but the hike in difficulty between Junior Cert level and Leaving Cert level was ridiculous, and in comparision, the Junior Cert looks like something for 10 year olds. Between completing the Junior Cert and starting the Leaving cert, most students opt to take a "Transition Year" - an optional year where they pay a lot of money to do sweet FA for the year. I chose to skip it, and was put in with a group of students that I got on with better, so Leaving Cert went by quickly. I applied on UCAS to SOAS to study BA Japanese, and achieved the grades I needed with no real effort so got in!

	<h1>SOAS, University of London</h1>
	<p>
		I moved then, to London - to persue my dream of learning Japanese. It fell flat, to tell the truth. However my year in SOAS was an experience I wouldn't trade for the world. I met some of the best friends of my life, and my wonderful boyfriend here, and I had a wonderful experience, having loads of fun, and learning the ropes of University. I had wonderful teachers, Kashiwagi-sensei being the most fun and informative there. It turned out about halfway through the year that I figured out Japanese wasn't my thing, and I bought a book on C++ relating to Games Programming and did a bit of that, and applied for (and was promptly accepted for) the course that brought me to...

	<h1>Goldsmiths, University of London</h1>
	<p>
		... Goldsmiths!!! I am here in my second round of first year doing Games Programming. I'm having fun, making new friends and learning how to code and stuff. The Games Development course is a little difficult but that's alright, I'm not doing too bad. Web dev is the most difficult for me because I've never been that good at designing things, especially websites, even with tools that skip the need to learn CSS, However I feel proud of what I've done here, regardless of how good it actually is. AV seems fun so far. Probably going to help a lot.
