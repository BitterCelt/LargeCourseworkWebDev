<div class="CVNorm work">
	<p>
		Coláiste Lurgan is a summer college where Irish students stay for three weeks and only speak Irish. My primary role was to assist in various tasks and activities around the college including cycling, aerobics and céilidhe (Evening traditional dances), caring for the students and making sure they were engaged in the programme and speaking Irish. I took care of any concerns the students had, making sure they felt welcome and were enjoying their time at Lurgan. I also was responsible for 13 students in the accommodation house making sure they behaved and were speaking Irish. My other responsibilities ranged from cleaning to being involved in the college’s music video projects.

	<p>
		I spent a day doing work experience in the local Vision express store in Athlone.  My responsibilities included helping to clear out the storeroom, and assist in the lab. I took phone calls from clientele and arranged appointments for them to come to the store and see the optometrist. I also was shown how to tighten the temples on glasses and was put in charge of tightening the temples of a pair of sunglasses for a customer.

<div class="CVNorm work">
	<p>
		During the summer of 2016 I stayed in Luton for the summer break. I got a job in the local Co-operative Food on a part-time contract.  I spent most of my time on the till delivering excellent service to our customers, serving quickly while being polite. I often did chiller refresh, putting out deliveries and facing up the shop. I tried to take the initiative and tidy up the storeroom whenever I didn’t have a specific job to do – sorting out the chiller and freezer and re-arranging cages and trolleys to make the most efficient use of space. I got on very well with my colleagues, able to get work done quickly and efficiently together, while still having a bit of banter while doing so. In October I was transferred to the Old Street store, having moved back to London for University. In this store I mainly work tills, as we are generally understaffed, and try to maintain good relationships with my new collegues.
